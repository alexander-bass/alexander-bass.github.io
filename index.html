        <strong>Hello!</strong> 
        Earlier today I was working on implementing 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading">cel shading</a> 
        into a program I am writing for CSC155, so I will write about that!
        To do this, I first had to figure out how a cel shader differs from my current Blinn-Phong lighting implementation. The main differences
        lie in how diffuse and specular lighting characteristics are calculated. Blinn-Phong calculates diffuse lighting based on the angle between
        the light and the surface normals of an object and produces a smooth, continuous gradient from light to shadow. Cel shading differs
        by breaking this smooth transition in to distanct bands of color, which gives it a more cartoony, hand-drawn look. 
        <strong>Very cool!</strong> 
        Similarly, specular highlights are simplified in cel shading, from a smooth gradient to a single sharp white spot. I also had to figure out how to
        do edge detection, but this is long enough. 
        <strong>Bye!</strong>
